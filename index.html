                <p>I'm trying not to, kid. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of
                    strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force
                    controlling everything. </p>
                <p>There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of
                    simple tricks and nonsense.</p>

                <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I call
                    it luck. </p>
                <p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them,
                    and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>

                    nothing I can do about it right now. </p>
                <p>It's such a long way from here. Leave that to me. Send a
